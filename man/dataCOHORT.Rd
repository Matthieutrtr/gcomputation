\title{
A Simulated Cohort from the PROPHYVAP Study
}
\description{
This dataset \code{dataCOHORT} is a simulated observational cohort study designed to reflect a real-world scenario similar to the PROPHYVAP clinical trial. The main objective of this study was to determine whether a single dose of ceftriaxone within the 12 hours post-intubation after severe brain injury can decrease the risk of early-onset VAP and mortality at 60 days. Unlike the randomized trial \code{\link{dataPROPHYVAP}}, the treatment allocation was influenced by patient characteristics.
